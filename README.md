# 🐧 Find the Penguins  
### 🎮 A Responsive Interactive Browser Game

**Find the Penguins** is a fun, fast-paced browser game where players search for hidden penguins beneath snowy mounds — while trying to avoid the sneaky yeti ❄️👣. The project focuses on **interactive UI design, responsive layout systems, and dynamic game logic** built entirely on the front end.

Designed as a lightweight but engaging mini-game, it demonstrates how clean visuals, responsive structure, and smart JavaScript logic can come together to create an enjoyable user experience across all devices.

## 🧠 Gameplay Concept

Players click on snow mounds arranged in a grid to reveal what’s hidden underneath.

- 🐧 Find penguins to score points  
- 👣 Reveal the yeti and the round ends  
- 🔁 Start again with a newly randomized board  

Each round is different, making the game unpredictable and replayable.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🎯 **Click-to-Reveal Game Mechanics**  
  Dynamic content reveal driven by DOM event handling.

- 🧩 **Randomized Game Logic**  
  Penguin and yeti positions reshuffle every round for fresh gameplay.

- 🎨 **Interactive Hover Feedback**  
  Smooth visual transitions improve user engagement before each click.

- 🔊 **Audio Interaction**  
  Distinct sound cues for penguin discoveries and yeti encounters.

- 🧠 **Live Score Tracking**  
  Tracks player performance and session high scores.

- 📱 **Fully Responsive Layout**  
  3×3 game board built using **CSS Grid** and `aspect-ratio` to stay perfectly square on all screen sizes.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- Clean separation of **game logic** and **UI updates**
- Efficient DOM manipulation using **JavaScript & jQuery**
- Smart state reset system to reinitialize the board without page reload
- Cross-device design ensuring consistent scaling and interaction behavior
- Attention to platform-specific quirks (hover, image loading, layout stability)
